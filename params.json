This means BB OS 7 will also fail with `id`, however changing `id` at runtime has never been a common or useful pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### About IE8\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any library out there able to bring IE8 to these levels, but the code used in this project is syntactically compatible with this old pal too ... moreover, if anyone would ever manage to bring the deprecated [Mutation events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Mutation_events) API to IE8, being the `observer` way more complex to shim, this library should work out of the box!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
